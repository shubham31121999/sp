    {
      question: "Do I need to be admitted for EEG, EMG, or ECG?",
      answer: "No. These are OPD-based, non-invasive tests and do not require admission unless you're already in the ICU or ER."
    },
    {
      question: "Is an ECG painful?",
      answer: "Not at all. ECG is a quick, painless test involving sticker-like leads on your chest, arms, and legs."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do these tests take?",
      answer: "ECG: 5–10 mins, EEG: 30–45 mins, EMG/NCV: 45–60 mins depending on complexity."
    },
    {
