    {
      question: "Do I need a referral for physiotherapy?",
      answer: `According to the NCAHP Act, 2021, physiotherapists in India are recognized as independent healthcare practitioners. This means you do not need a referral from a doctor to consult a physiotherapist. You can directly access physiotherapy services for evaluation and treatment.

However, for insurance purposes, a referral may still be requested—so it’s a good idea to check with your healthcare provider.`
    },
    {
      question: "How often do I need to come for therapy?",
      answer: "The number of sessions depends on your condition and recovery goals. Some patients improve in a few visits, while others may need ongoing therapy for several weeks."
    },
    {
      question: "Is physiotherapy painful?",
      answer: "Some discomfort may be experienced during certain treatments or exercises, especially in early sessions. Your physiotherapist will work with you to ensure it is safe and manageable."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I wear to my physiotherapy appointment?",
      answer: "Wear loose, comfortable clothing that allows easy movement. If your problem is with a specific body part (e.g., knee, shoulder), wear clothing that allows access to that area."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens during my first physiotherapy session?",
      answer: `Your physiotherapist will:
- Take a detailed history

Treatment may start on the same day.`
